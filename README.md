# Kreeps
Kreeps is a tower defense game where you choose how your towers, and how the enemies scale as the game progresses. This project was built in my free time for the purpose of learning the Unity engine with C#, and to see If I could build a game and successfully publish on steam.

## Game loop overview
At the end of each wave the player makes 3 choices:

## 1. Select a location
Location choices give all Kreeps a permanent buff and also extend the path. These buffs stack as the game progresses.

## 2. Select a Kreep
Kreep choices are added to each following wave.

## 3. Select a shop card
The shop provides the choice of a weapon to purchase, 3 random free upgrades, or the choice of extra gold. Only 1 can be selected each wave.

## Choose from 7 different types of towers and weapons each with their own unique upgrades for a variety of strategies to choose from.

## There are 6 different types of Kreeps each with their own weakness.
