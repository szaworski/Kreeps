# Kreeps
Kreeps is a tower defense game where you choose how your towers, and how the enemies scale as the game progresses. This project was built in my free time for the purpose of learning the Unity engine with C#, and to see If I could build a game and successfully publish on steam.

## Game loop overview
At the end of each wave the player makes 3 choices:

## 1. Select a location
Location choices give all Kreeps a permanent buff and also extend the path. These buffs stack as the game progresses.

## 3. Select a shop card
The shop provides the choice of a weapon to purchase, 3 random free upgrades, or the choice of extra gold. Only 1 can be selected each wave.
